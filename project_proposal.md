##  Startup Business Success - Problem



Predicting the success of a business venture has always been a struggle for both practitioners and researchers. Success for a start-up is defined here as the event that gives a large amount of money to the companyâ€™s founders, investors and early employees, specifically through a process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). 

The ability to predict success is an invaluable advantage for business owners who are looking for investments since best targets for investors are those who have the potential for growing rapidly soon, which ultimately, allows investors to be one step ahead of competition.

  

## Predicting Business Success
  

The main goal of this project is to predict whither a startup business will succeed or not by applying supervised machine learning solutions. After acquiring data from different sources, i am going to apply feature engineering and data cleaning algorithms using Pandas. 

 subsequently, I an planning to build a classification model and evaluate that model to help clients in predicting business success. the clients of this project are:

  
- Startups 

- Business Owners

- Investors

  

### Data Sources
  
The aquired data in this project is Crunchbase 2013 Snapshot from 
[crunchbase.com](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs ) which provide API to access four data sets: Companies, Investments, rounds and acquisitions.
i'm going to apply data cleaning and feature engineering to obtain a final dataset that serves the model
## MVP
- EDA and applying Data cleaning algorithms.
- Building and comparing several Classification models.
