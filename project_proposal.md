##  Startup Business Success - Problem



Predicting the success of a business venture has always been a struggle for both practitioners and researchers. Success for a start-up is defined here as the event that gives a large amount of money to the companyâ€™s founders, investors and early employees, specifically through a process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). 

The ability to predict success is an invaluable advantage for business owners who are looking for investments since best targets for investors are those who have the potential for growing rapidly soon, which ultimately, allows investors to be one step ahead of competition.

  

## Predicting Business Success
  

The main goal of this project is to predict whither a startup business will succeed or not by applying supervised machine learning solutions. After acquiring data from different sources, i am going to apply feature engineering and data cleaning algorithms using Pandas. 

 subsequently, I an planning to build a classification model and evaluate that model to help clients in predicting business success. the clients of this project are:

  
- Startups 

- Business Owners

- Investors

  

### Data Sources

  

In this project, We intend to scrape two website and use additional dataset for more comprehensive used car data.

  

-  [Autotrader](https://www.autotrader.com/) : An online marketplace for car buyers and sellers. It aggregates new, used, and certified second-hand cars from dealers and private sellers.

-  [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/): Website for shopping and selling used cars. there is a list of features for each car.

-  [Craigslist Cars-trucks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) : a dataset from Craigslist. it contains all relevant information on used car sales including price, condition, manufacturer, and other 23 columns. the dataset is scraped every few months has over 426k rows.
